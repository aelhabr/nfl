# Introduction

This project is under active development.
This intentions and work of this project exactly mirror those of my `nba` repo,
but for the NFL. (The primary data source here is <https://www.pro-football-reference.com/>
instead of <<https://www.basketball-reference.com>.
See that repo for more details (in order to avoid redundancy :)).

# Highlights

Unforuantely, no visualizations have been saved during my work on this project up to this point.
(However, some of my work in my `mail` package uses data from this project.)
